    <div id="p1_goals_paragraph">Select a book title that allows for dynamic visual expression and use typography and studio image-making techniques, such as painting, stenciling, and collaging, to express the concept. Design, print, and construct a book jacket and slipcase that fit around an actual book. Learn to work across physical and digital mediums by bringing physical work into digital form and back into physical form. Learn to work with typography and imaging that wraps around multiple surfaces, and consider the reveal-conceal relationship between two elements (the slipcase and jacket). Represent a dynamic concept through abstraction.</div>

    <div id="description-container-process-flex">
    <div id="p1_process_heading">Process</div>
    <div id="p1_process_paragraph">I began by brainstorming, sketching, and physically experimenting with the different dynamic title possibilities. I committed to a concept corresponding to Lewis Carrolâ€™s Through the Looking-Glass. In the jacket, I wanted to illustrate the title moving through the glass and entering wonderland. The front cover would show the glass from one side and the back cover would show the glass from the other side. I executed this by creating a glass-resembling device made of layered and torn tracing paper. I attempted to print out the words of the title and physically thread them between the layers of the glass-like device. However, to create a cleaner appearance, I decided to scan the glass-like device and add the typography digitally in a way that made it look as if it was still passing between the layers of paper. I created the background separately, by spattering white paint onto black paper. I scanned this piece as well. In Photoshop, I brought together the scanned paint texture, the scanned tracing paper, and digital typography. I organized the separate elements across a book jacket template that I adjusted to match the dimensions of an actual book. I used the same scanned elements to create the slipcase in a Photoshop template. I printed, scored, trimmed, folded, and pasted the sides of the book jacket and slipcase.</div>
