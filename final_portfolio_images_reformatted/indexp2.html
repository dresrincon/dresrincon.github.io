    <div id="p1_goals_paragraph">Create a set of typographic blocks that captures the essence and the uniqueness of a particular typeface’s letterforms. The blocks should function well on their own but also as a set, with the capability of coming together to form multiple compositions. The blocks should display all of the typeface’s letterforms and should describe characteristics of the typeface. The artwork should complement the aesthetic qualities of the typeface. The blocks should be 2.5” square and should be accompanied by a 11” by 14” poster that showcases the typeface and fits the design of the blocks.</div>

    <div id="p1_process_heading">Process</div>
    <div id="p1_process_paragraph">I decided to represent the typeface Neutraface through my typographic blocks. The development of the blocks involved collecting Neutraface Book’s letterforms and carefully identifying and labeling the characteristics that make the typeface unique. I then carried out research on the typeface and the typeface’s creator Richard Neutra, which led me to base my design concepts on Palm Springs, architecture, and vintage Hollywood. I created a mood board to provide inspiration in terms of color scheme, look, and feel. I approached the design of the blocks by creating six different 5” by 7.5” compositions, to later split into six and distribute into the sides of each block accordingly. Through this strategy, I assured that each side of each block connected to each side of the other six blocks. To ensure that each layout would split cleanly, I created an InDesign template where I could see each block, its sides, and how each side interacted with the others. I also printed and built out several prototypes to ensure that the blocks would look balanced and cohesive in three-dimensional form. I built the final six blocks from cardstock and used rubber cement to adhere the sides together.</div>
