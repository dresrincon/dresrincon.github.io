    <div id="p1_goals_paragraph">Create a logo that is highly recognizable, that offers opportunities for movement/animation,that is conceptually rooted in “echoes,” and that embodies “bold, fun, sexy/edgy.” Choose and create supplementary brand elements such as colors and forms to use consistently across branded content. Create a digital and print ad campaign that leverages social media and word of mouth to heighten awareness of the acappella group, the 2018 Spring Concert, and consequently doubles attendance at the concert. Create posters and table tents to place around campus, animated content for the group’s official social accounts, and individualized content for each member to post and increase their individual ticket sales.</div>

    <div id="p1_process_heading">Process</div>
    <div id="p1_process_paragraph">Brand Identity: Identified the “bold, fun, sexy/edgy” adjectives to describe and differentiate our group, and ideated logomarks resembling sound waves. Chose and polished the reverberating “e” mark, and chose blue and gold colors and other brand elements (like typefaces, outlined strokes, and repeated marks in background) to heighten the “fun” aspect.
    Campaign: Identified importance of leveraging each individual’s promotional involvement, and branded the concert and campaign as “bold, fun, sexy/edgy.” Determined three-image split design for the digital elements and table tents as well as colorful direction of the campaign. Held photoshoot for all 17 members, edited and color-balanced the pictures, created and used a template for the digital compositions and table tents, and asked members to share their individual compositions. Created “scroll” animations for official social accounts, and created and distributed two poster designs and table tents visually consistent with other content. I ultimately doubled concert attendance. The Fall 2019 Auditions Poster shows another direction in which to extend the brand. It stays on brand despite deviating from the visual system of the Spring 2018 campaign</div>
