    <div id="p1_goals_paragraph">I'm a third-year student at the University of Notre Dame pursuing a double major in Marketing and Visual Communication Design. At my core is a desire to use my business acumen and written, verbal, and visual communication skills to do social good. I aspire to produce meaningful and impactful work as a graphic designer and/or art director for an advertising, design, or creative agency. I believe that my background in marketing and design, as well as the semesters spent balancing the demands of business classes and design classes, set me apart from other design or art majors. My passion for creating and representing ideas visually, my tenacity and work ethic, as well as my ability to solve problems as a designer and businessman will take me far in this field. This website compiles the best work that I have produced so far. It represents countless hours of hard work, showcases my attention to detail, the manner in which I solve problems as a designer, and also offers a glimpse into my imagination. Take a look around and contact me. I would love to work with you!
