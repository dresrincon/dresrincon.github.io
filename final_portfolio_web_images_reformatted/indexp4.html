    <div id="p1_goals_paragraph">Create a non-traditional book displaying a collection of found samples of each letter of the alphabet. Each letter should contain at least ten letters and the samples must come from at least twenty sources. Collecting samples of letters from magazines, billboards, packaging, logos, and other typography in the environment should increase awareness of effective and ineffective typography. The book displaying the letters should reflect a strong visual concept that appropriately integrates the found letters with the overall design. </div>

    <div id="p1_process_paragraph">As I began to take pictures of letters that I saw in my surroundings, I decided that I wanted to create a book that illustrated emotions through human subjects interacting with letters. I sketched out what I wanted each composition to look like and photographed several models to match my sketches. I traced the most successful pictures manually to create line drawings of the human figures, scanned the drawings, and placed them in their corresponding compositions in InDesign. I simultaneously used Illustrator to extract each found letter from its picture. After extracting over 260 letters, I placed them in their corresponding compositions in InDesign, using their interactions with the human drawings to communicate the corresponding emotions. During the refining stage, I added colors to each composition to help illustrate the corresponding emotions. After finishing the book digitally, I decided that I wanted the printed book to be an accordion-fold. I wanted the physical unfolding of colored pages to represent the human range of emotion. I printed the compositions and used adhesive to bind them to each other. The cover involved using the laser cutter and creating a composition of the drawings that would be visible through the cover. The end product successfully showcased 26 emotions through the use of color, illustration, and the interaction between letterforms and drawing</div>
